created an interactive commercial sales data analysis dashboard
🎉 First Task Completed as a Data Analytics Intern at Brainwave Matrix Solutions!
Thrilled to share that I’ve just wrapped up my first project as a Data Analytics Intern—and it’s been a powerful start! 🚀
📊 I created an interactive commercial sales data dashboard using Power BI, designed to help stakeholders quickly identify:
🔍 Top-performing products

This dashboard transforms raw sales data into a dynamic, decision-ready tool—making analytics accessible and impactful.
